## Overview

This repository presents a study on Ireland's pandemic responses. Using Bayesian modelling, we analyze how lockdowns and vaccinations impact all-cause deaths, including COVID-19. Results highlight the effectiveness of these measures in reducing mortality. The provided code and data enable you to replicate our analyses, visualize the results, and potentially extend our research in new directions.


## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **dataset.rds:** This rds file is the final dataset used in our study. 

- **paper_codes:** Here, you'll find the codebase used for analysis, and visualization.
